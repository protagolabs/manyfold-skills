# Manyfold CLI (`mf`) — agent guide

Operate Manyfold resources on the user's behalf through the `mf` CLI.
This guide works inside a Manyfold-managed runtime and in an external
coding agent. Identity and browser availability are separate capabilities.

## Establish identity and target

Check `mf version` and `mf whoami --json`. Honor the user's selected profile
and API URL throughout the task; `mf profile show --json` reports saved
configuration without exposing credentials. A profile name or CLI release
channel alone does not determine the deployment.

- **Managed runtime** (`kind: "agent-runtime"`): the platform injects
  `MF_API_TOKEN`, `MF_AGENT_ID`, and `MF_API_URL`. Use that identity and
  endpoint. Do not run `mf login` or switch to a personal profile to bypass
  its permissions. `MF_DEPLOY_ENV` may also identify the deployment.
- **External user session** (`human-session` or `human-api-token`): use the
  selected CLI profile. If authentication is missing, run
  `mf --profile <profile> login` and let the user finish the browser flow.
  Select a target from `mf agent list --json` and pass `--agent-id` when a
  command needs it; `MF_AGENT_ID` need not exist. Login currently grants
  `api.full`; a profile isolates configuration, not permissions.
- If a managed runtime's identity is missing or rejected, report the runtime
  authentication problem. Do not replace it with a user login. Use the
  command's structured error to distinguish missing authentication from a
  missing scope; status 401 alone does not establish which one failed.

When `mf` is absent outside Manyfold, use the official installer at
https://manyfold.ai/cli/install.sh. Resource management only needs the CLI;
`mf setup` also registers this computer as an execution host and is appropriate
only when requested. Read `mf help auth --agent` for login and scope details.

## Managed agent scope

An authenticated managed agent operates on its own resources by default.
For account-wide actions, add `--account`; the API checks the required grants
and same-account ownership. If a command reports a missing grant:

```sh
mf auth ensure --scopes channels:read,channels:edit
```

Request **only the scope you are missing** (existing permissions are
KEPT — approval appends). The CLI prints a consent URL — **post exactly
that URL to the user** and ask them to approve. Never paste any token in
chat. The command exits after printing the URL; once the user approves,
just retry — the platform reads the added scope live. Details:
`mf help auth --agent`.

Examples for a managed identity reaching beyond its own agent:

```sh
mf automations list --account                       # across ALL your agents
mf automations list --account --agent-id agt_other  # a specific other agent
mf agent list --account                             # every agent on the account
```

Targeting another agent without `--account` is rejected. These managed-agent
grant rules do not mean every external user command needs `--account`.
For an external API token with insufficient scopes, use an appropriately
authorized token/profile; `mf auth ensure` grants a managed agent's scopes.

## Topics

- `mf help --agent` — entry guide: auth, topics, failure recovery
- `mf help auth --agent` — login, scopes, consent URL, token safety
- `mf help safety --agent` — hard rules: secrets, consent URL, scope grants
- `mf help channels --agent` — Telegram, Slack, Discord, Lark channel management
- `mf help channels create --agent` — creating a channel step by step
- `mf help channels send --agent` — agent-initiated sends: DM, chat post, native reply
- `mf help automations --agent` — scheduled jobs: create, run and follow, read results, update, delete
- `mf help files --agent` — agent workspace files: list, read, write, mv, rm
- `mf help model-config --agent` — read or update the agent model configuration
- `mf help model-providers --agent` — which saved or managed providers can serve a new agent, and its models
- `mf help skills --agent` — install, discover and manage agent skills
- `mf help mcp --agent` — an agent's MCP servers: list, add, install, remove, pull, push
- `mf help connections --agent` — external accounts (GitHub, Cloudflare, Composio) linked to the agent
- `mf help runtime --agent` — runtime lifecycle, control UI, dashboard
- `mf help sandbox --agent` — list, update and delete sandboxes; storage readings and attribution
- `mf help agent --agent` — create (model source, sandbox reuse), list, update, send and chat (talk to an agent), delete, credentials
- `mf help backups --agent` — agent snapshots: list, create, restore
- `mf help usage --agent` — token and cost statistics
- `mf help a2a --agent` — call A2A servers or manage this agent’s A2A exposure and callers

Add `--json` to any `mf help … --agent` call for a machine-readable
envelope (`topic`, `cliVersion`, `topics`, `content`). Most commands also
accept `--json`; with it, the result is raw JSON on stdout and a failure is
emitted on stderr as
`{ "error": { "code", "status"?, "message", "hint"?, "details"? } }`
(never the raw response body), so both success and failure stay parseable.
`details` comes with the codes a script can act on, such as
`RUNTIME_LIMIT_REACHED`; every plan limit or quota (`*_LIMIT_REACHED`,
`*_QUOTA_REACHED`) puts `current`, `limit` and `planName` there. Exit codes
are stable in every mode: 2 network
failure, 3 auth (401/403), 4 not found, 5 invalid usage or arguments
(400/422), 130 interrupted (Ctrl-C), 1 anything else. A command that runs
a check (`mf doctor`, `mf model-providers test`, `mf channels test` and
`register`) also exits 1 when the check fails, with its report still on
stdout. `mf <command> --help` shows human-readable flags.

## Execution and recovery

- Read the relevant topic and current command help before an unfamiliar
  operation. Do not assume every Web operation has a CLI equivalent.
- Refresh the targeted resource before editing. Distinguish request
  acceptance from completion and inspect the exact returned run/job ID.
- After a timeout, inspect whether a create or run request took effect before
  retrying it. A failed run is not permission to submit another one.
  `mf agent create` is the exception: rerunning the same command attaches
  to its create if that is still under way, or returns the agent it made.
- An ownership rejection requires checking identity and target, not
  repeatedly requesting scopes. Unknown flags require current command help.
- Follow existing user authorization; creating a schedule, running it now,
  and sending its result to an external channel are distinct actions.

## Safety (always applies)

- Never print `~/.manyfold/profiles/<name>/config.json`, any file below a
  profile's `daemon/` directory, or any token value.
- Only share the consent URL with the user — the URL alone is safe.
- Request the minimum scopes the task needs.
- Full rules: `mf help safety --agent`

## Optional guidance

Load only the references needed for the current task:

- [Authentication](references/auth.md) covers external user login and managed
  runtime grants. The verified identity remains authoritative when an older
  installed CLI's help assumes that every caller is a managed agent.
- [A2A](references/a2a.md) covers delegation and task tracking. Use it when
  talking to a peer or an external A2A server.
- [Workbench](references/workbench.md) covers showing resources and automation
  results. Use [Web routes](references/web-routes.md) to choose the deployment
  origin and resource URL.

Browser capability is optional. When a pane is available, reuse it to show
the live resource; otherwise provide a link when its Web origin is known.
Missing browser controls or an unknown Web URL must not block authorized
CLI work. Never claim visual verification without inspecting the page.

The same `manyfold-cli-usage` skill is distributed independently and inside
the Manyfold plugin. Reuse already-loaded guidance rather than loading a
second copy for the same task. This skill manages platform resources; it
does not define how to develop the Manyfold source repository.
